An application using node.js, with express and mongoDB.
The application will be set up to take data from the user and store it in the mongoDB server.
The app will have three pages, 1. signup, 2. login, 3. user profile. 

This is still a work in progress. 

Things still to complete:

1. Fix error catch. 
2. Write code for the comparison of user data, to data base. (Done.)
3. Get the login page to render when data is entered correctly (Done.)
4. Design the profile page and features.
5. Styling for the app.

 

UPdate: I have added controllers folder/file and a routes folder. The app files have been seperated, making
the project more readable and managable.
